---

In this module, you will enable the Chatter feed for orders, so users can collaborate around them, and view the finished integration in the Salesforce1 mobile app.

## What you will learn
- Configure Chatter for an external object
- Show external data in the Salesforce1 mobile app

## Step 1: Configure Chatter for Order Records

In the current release, *field tracking* is not available for external objects; that is, we cannot configure Salesforce to automatically post to a record's Chatter feed as its field values change, but we can still enable the Chatter feed.

1. Login to your Salesforce Developer Edition

1. Click **Setup** (upper right corner)

1. Click **Customize** > **Chatter** > **Feed Tracking** (left navigation).

1. Select **Orders** (note the plural - the singular Order is a standard object), click **Enable Feed Tracking** and click **Save**.

1. If the app menu (top right) is not already showing **External Orders**, then click the app menu and select it.

1. Click the **Orders** tab.

1. Click the External ID of an order in the Recent Orders list.

1. Now the order should have a Chatter feed.

1. Post some text to the Chatter feed. We'll see how it looks in the Salesforce1 mobile app.

## Step 2: View External Data in Salesforce1

1. Start the Salesforce1 mobile app. You can run Salesforce1 on your mobile device ([get the app](http://www.salesforce.com/mobile)), in the [Salesforce1 Simulator Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce1-simulator/cknbjckicenodbiaejbmkjhldffonggp), or by opening a new browser window with the URL [https://login.salesforce.com/one/one.app](https://login.salesforce.com/one/one.app) (login with your Developer Edition username and password if necessary).

1. Click the **navigation icon** (top left) to open the navigation menu. You should see Accounts and Orders at the top of the Recent list. If they are not at the top, then click **Show More** to show all the objects in the Recent list.

1. Click **Orders** to see a list of recent orders.

	> In addition to the external object that you have configured, there is a standard object with the same name, Orders. If you click Orders and see no recent records, look for the other Orders object.

1. The order you were viewing in the previous step should be top of the list. Click it to view its details.

1. Click the **Related** tab, then 'OrderDetails' to see the order's line items.

1. Click the **back arrow** (top left) twice, then click the **navigation icon** (top left) to open the navigation menu. Click **Accounts** to see a list of recent accounts.

1. Click the top account in the list, then click **Related**, scroll down the related lists and then click **Orders** to see the orders for that account.

Your external data is available in Salesforce1 just as it is in the desktop browser, with zero additional configuration!
